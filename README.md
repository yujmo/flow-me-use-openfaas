This is a plugin to enable Kubernetes as an [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) backend. The existing CLI and UI are fully compatible. It also opens up the possibility for other plugins to be built for orchestation frameworks such as Nomad,  Mesos/Marathon or even a cloud-managed back-end such as Hyper.sh or Azure ACI.

**Update:** [Watch the demo and intro to the CNCF Serverless Workgroup](https://youtu.be/SwRjPiqpFTk?t=1m8s)

[OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) is an event-driven serverless framework for containers. Any container for Windows or Linux can be leveraged as a serverless function. OpenFaaS is quick and easy to deploy (less than 60 secs) and lets you avoid writing boiler-plate code.

![Stack](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/08bc7c0c4f882ef5eadaed797388b27b1a3ca056/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f4446726b46344e586f41414a774e322e6a7067)

In this README you'll find a technical overview and instructions for deploying FaaS on a Kubernetes cluster. 

> Docker Swarm is also supported. 

* Serverless framework for containers
* Native Kubernetes support
* Built-in UI
* YAML templates
* Over 6k GitHub stars

### QuickStart

If you're looking to just get OpenFaaS deployed on Kubernetes follow the [QuickStart guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/guide/deployment_k8s.md) or read on for a technical overview.

> To try the experimental `helm` chart click here [helm guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/blob/master/HELM.md).

### How is this project different from others?

* [Read an Introduction to OpenFaaS here](https://blog.alexellis.io/introducing-functions-as-a-service/).

## Technical overview

The code in this repository is a daemon or micro-service which can provide the basic functionality the FaaS Gateway requires:

* List functions
* Deploy function
* Delete function
* Invoke function synchronously

Any other metrics or UI components will be maintained separately in the main OpenFaaS project.

**Motivation for separate micro-service:**

* Kubernetes go-client is 41MB with only a few lines of code
* After including the go-client the code takes > 2mins to compile

So rather than inflating the original project's source-code this micro-service will act as a co-operator or plug-in. Some additional changes will be needed in the main OpenFaaS project to switch between implementations.

There is no planned support for dual orchestrators - i.e. Swarm and K8s at the same time on the same host/network.

### Get started with the code

Let's try it out:

* Create a single-node cluster on our Mac
* Deploy a function manually with `kubectl`
* Build and deploy the FaaS-netes microservice
* Make calls to list the functions and invoke a function

I'll give instructions for creating your cluster on a Mac with `minikube`, but you can also use `kubeadm` on Linux in the cloud by [following this tutorial](https://blog.alexellis.io/kubernetes-kubeadm-video/).

**Create a cluster on Mac:**

```
$ minikube start --vm-driver=xhyve
```

> You can also omit `--vm-driver=xhyve` if you want to use VirtualBox for your local cluster.

**Deploy FaaS-netes and the API Gateway**

```
$ kubectl apply -f ./faas.yml,monitoring.yml
```

The `monitoring.yml` file provides Prometheus and AlertManager functionality for metrics and auto-scaling behaviour.

If you're using `kubeadm` and *RBAC* then you can run in a cluster role for FaaS-netes:

```
$ kubectl apply -f ./rbac.yml
```

**Deploy a tester function**

You have three options for deploying a function:

* Via the OpenFaaS CLI 

The CLI can build OpenFaaS functions into Docker images that you can share via the Docker Hub. These can also be deployed through the same tool using a YAML format.

Available at: https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli

> Note: currently Kubernetes OpenFaaS functions can only be named a-zA-Z and dash (-).

* Through the OpenFaaS UI

The OpenFaaS UI is accessible in a web-browser on port 31112 with the IP of your node.

See below for a screenshot.

* Manual deployment + service with a label of "faas_function=<function_name>"

```
$ kubectl delete deployment/nodeinfo ; \
  kubectl delete service/nodeinfo ; \
  kubectl run --labels="faas_function=nodeinfo" nodeinfo --port 8080 --image functions/nodeinfo:latest ; \
  kubectl expose deployment/nodeinfo
```

* The label `faas_function=<function_name>` marks this as a "function"

### Now try it out

**Function List**

The function list is available on the gateway and is also used by the OpenFaaS UI.

Find the gateway service:

```
$ kubectl get service gateway
NAME      CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
gateway   10.106.11.234   <nodes>       8080:31112/TCP   1h
```

You can now use the node's IP address and port 31112 or the Cluster IP and port 8080.

Using the internal IP:

```
$ minikube ssh 'curl -s 10.106.11.234:8080/system/functions'

[{"name":"nodeinfo","image":"functions/nodeinfo:latest","invocationCount":0,"replicas":1}]
```

Or via the node's IP and NodePort we mapped (31112):

```
$ curl -s http://$(minikube ip):31112/system/functions

[{"name":"nodeinfo","image":"functions/nodeinfo:latest","invocationCount":0,"replicas":1}]
```

**Invoke a function via the API Gateway**

Using the IP from the previous step you can now invoke the `nodeinfo` function with a HTTP POST and an empty body.

```
curl -s --data "" http://$(minikube ip):31112/function/nodeinfo
Hostname: nodeinfo-2186484981-lcm0m

Platform: linux
Arch: x64
CPU count: 2
Uptime: 19960
```

The `--data` flag turns the `curl` from a GET to a POST. Right now OpenFaaS functions are invoked via a POST to the API Gateway.

> The nodeinfo function also supports a parameter of `verbose` to view network adapters - to try this set the `--data` flag to `verbose`.

**Manually scale a function**

Let's scale the deployment from 1 to 2 instances of the nodeinfo function:

```
$ kubectl scale deployment/nodeinfo --replicas=2
```

You can now use the `curl` example from above and you will see either of the two replicas.

**Auto-scale your functions**

Given enough load (> 5 requests/second) OpenFaaS will auto-scale your service, you can test this out by opening up the Prometheus web-page and then generating load with Apache Bench or a while/true/curl bash loop.

Here's an example you can use to generate load:

```
ip=$(minikube ip); while [ true ] ; do curl $ip:31112/function/nodeinfo -d "" ; done
```

Prometheus is exposed on a NodePort of 31119 which shows the function invocation rate. 

```
$ open http://$(minikube ip):31119/
```

Here's an example for use with the Prometheus UI:

```
rate(gateway_function_invocation_total[20s])
```

> It shows the rate the function has been invoked over a 20 second window.

The [OpenFaaS complete walk-through on Kubernetes Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DbrLsUvaso) shows auto-scaling in action and how to use the Prometheus UI.

**Test out the UI**

You can also access the OpenFaaS UI through the node's IP address and the NodePort we exposed earlier.

```
$ open http://$(minikube ip):31112/
```

If you've ever used the *Kubernetes dashboard* then this UI is a similar concept. You can list, invoke and create new functions.
